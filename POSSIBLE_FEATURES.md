# Possible Features


## These are some possible features that may be implemented one of these days

No guarrantee

### A Semblance of Type Safety

#### Subclass List

Make a class called _list_of inside a list_of function.

That class would override \__setitem__ to enforce the type compliance of items in that list.

Could be used with the "declares/requires" features so that types of attributes can be required. Can use their mechanisms for specifying the types of the elements within.

Implicitly thus also sets that attribute to an empty list.

Could conceivably be extended to other container types.
