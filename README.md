actools
=======

Python classes that have been, are or could be useable to Andrew Chen ( contact him through http://www.facebook.com/DrAndrewChen )

#purpose

Most of this is for the little scripts that Dr. Andrew Chen writes as part of what he does, whether that is in his employment as an (Associate) Professor at MSUM ( http://www.mnstate.edu ) or not via said employment, but for some other purpose (such as recreation or other employment).

#directory structure
##Code

The plan is that they will implicitly assume certain things about the directory structure so that sub directories can "inherit" modules defined in the directories above them - actually, defined in the "Code" subdirectories of all parent directories.

An exception will be made in the event that an "actools" directory is found within the "Code" directory, in which case it will then be used instead.

##Data
Similar to how "Code" is handled, so too there will be "Data"

#goals
There are many goals, to be described here.

##Miscellaneous
A good set of coding conventions, along with some other useful classes/functions are intended. For more on conventions, see CONVENTIONS.md
